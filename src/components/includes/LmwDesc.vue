    My favorite project. <br/>
    Reasons:<br/>
    <ol>
      <li>The first project I felt challenging as a new comer in computer programming.</li>
      <li>It awakened the programmer in me. (And I learned the importance of using a debugger)</li>
      <li>The end result is tangible, and it has a retro 8-bit game feel.</li>
    </ol>
